### Hello there 👋

My name is Alessio Izzo, I am a software engineer from Italy. Here is my tagline, that I use everywhere

_I live my life one line of (buggy) code at a time..._

#### Programming Languages

I work mostly in python 🐍 but I also used javascript/typescript in React projects. 
I'd like to learn/work with a different programming language every year (I played with golang and rust)

#### Interests

- Coding interviews: I thing that the hiring process is one of the most important aspects that a company should care of. You can find a talk where I tell my point of view here => [who really needs to crack the coding interview?](https://www.youtube.com/live/c55Q-JgHVNo?feature=share)
- Open Source: I contributed to a bunch of great project and I learn a lot by doing it
  - [requests](https://github.com/psf/requests): fix failing doctests
  - [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest): fix a bug that enables the usage of the walrus operator in assertions
  Plus, I participate to the [Open Source Saturday](https://github.com/oss-italy) whenever I can
